**INTRODUCTION**

*This project helps in properly visualising as well as understanding the rapid change in biomass distribution in the last ~60 years. @Bar-On6506* 
*It is a way to fact check all the different headlines that have been going around recently like how humans contribution to the present state of the planet has been more than 83% but by themselves they only make up 0.01% of the life present on earth. @the_guardian_2018 *

*How the population sizes of mammals, fish, birds, reptiles, and amphibians have declined an average of 68% between 1970 and 2016, according to World Wildlife Fund’s (WWF) Living Planet Report 2020. Populations in Latin America and the Caribbean have fared worst, with an average decline of 94%. Global freshwater species have also been disproportionately impacted, declining 84% on average. As an important indicator of planetary health, these drastic species population trends signal a fundamentally broken relationship between humans and the natural world, the consequences of which—as demonstrated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic—can be catastrophic. `@wwf_2020` * 

*In order better understand the actual meaning behind these numbers, biomass distribution has been used which can be used to depict the size of a species with respect to all the lifeforms.*

**DATA**

*This project consists of data pulled from 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (@ipcc) and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (@faostat) for data regarding the mass index and distribution of poultry and livestock in different regions of the world (North and Latin America, Asia, Indian Subcontinent, Oceania and Africa). The aim of this project was to map out the change in the biomass distribution and analyze how human activities have affected the environment in the past 60 years. The main focus will be on terrestrial lifeforms (animals) and humans.*

*The project can be broken down into two sections: Wrangling and Visualization. As I will be referring to various data sets in this project, cleaning and structuring is a big part of it. *

**WRANGLING**

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE)
library(tidyverse)
```
*70% humany body is water => 30% carbon x 50% carbon out of the dry weight. Also the average of the human body is being assumed at 50 kgs. Also, 1kg is equal to 0.15 C which is stored in the variable `to_carbon` @Hern1999.*
*`bird_bm` and `mammal_bm` store the total biomass of the birds and mammals on earth and `wild_animal_biomass` stores the total biomass of the wild animals on earth.*
*These values have been used as constants in this notebook for easy conversion. For this project, the total biomass on earth has been assumed to be ~550 Gt C, being such a large number any change in it is bound to be insignificant concerning only a span of 60 years.*
```{r}
regions <- sort(c("Africa", "Latin America", "Asia", "Eastern Europe", "Northern America", "Oceania", "Indian Subcontinent", "Western Europe" ))
converter = 1000*0.15/1e15 #kg to Gt
wild_animal_biomass = 550 * 3 * 1e-6
birds_bm = 0.007 #Gt C
mammmal_bm = 550 * 3 * 1e-4
to_carbon = 0.15
human_carbon_mass = 5e4 * to_carbon
```
*Loading the data on human population over the years and converting it into Gt C and calculating the changing biomass and %age biomass over the years*
```{r}
human_pop <- readxl::read_excel("../../_data/Data_Extract_From_World_Development_Indicators.xlsx") %>% slice(1) %>%
    select(! contains("Series") & ! contains("Country")) %>%
    pivot_longer(cols = names(.),names_to = "Year", values_to = "Population") %>%
    mutate(Year = as.numeric(str_extract(Year, '[^\\s]+'))) %>%
    mutate(`Total Biomass (Gt C)` = as.double(`Population`) * human_carbon_mass * 1e-15) %>%
    mutate(`% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)` / (mammmal_bm * 1e-2))

    
tail(human_pop)
```
*Loading the mass Index for poultry and modifying the Area name and Region as per the requirement, the areas under focus have been listed down below*

```{r}
birds_index <- read.csv('../../_data/birds.csv') %>%
  mutate(Area = case_when(
    Area == "Southern Asia" ~ "Indian Subcontinent",
    Area == "Americas" ~ "Latin America",
    TRUE ~ Area
  )) %>%
  filter(Area %in% regions) %>%
  arrange(Area, Item)
head(birds_index)
unique(as.data.frame(birds_index[,"Area"]))
```
*Using bird_index the information on chicken is extracted out which only the Area, Year and Value columns are seleccted. The Values of Latin America and Asia are modified by subtracting Northern America  and Indian Subcontinent respectively to avoid repitition.*
```{r}
chicken <- filter(birds_index, Item == "Chickens") %>%
  select(Area, Year, Value) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Area, values_from = Value) %>%
  mutate(`Latin America` = `Latin America` - `Northern America`, Asia = Asia - `Indian Subcontinent`) %>%
  column_to_rownames('Year')
head(chicken)
```
*The dataset on chickens laying eggs is loaded and stored in `chicken_layers` and is formatted to match the table above.*
```{r}
chicken_layers <- read.csv('../../_data/FAOSTAT_egg_chicken.csv') %>%
  mutate(Area = case_when(
    Area == "Southern Asia" ~ "Indian Subcontinent",
    Area == "Americas" ~ "Latin America",
    TRUE ~ Area
  )) %>%
  filter(Area %in% regions & Element == "Laying") %>%
  arrange(Area) %>%
  select(Area, Year, Value) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Area, values_from = Value) %>%
  mutate(`Latin America` = `Latin America` - `Northern America`, Asia = Asia - `Indian Subcontinent`) %>%
  column_to_rownames('Year')
  
head(chicken_layers)
```
*To calculate the biomass of chicken first chicken is seperated into two categories- broilers and layers. The resulting separate dataframes are multiplied by the avg weight as per the @ipcc standards i.e.  0.9 and 1.8 kgs. The output obtained is then stored together in `chicken_all` where the added weights are converted into Biomass(Gt C) then the actual %age of Total Biomass is calculated as well. The chicken_all dataframe adds both the dataframes together. The sum of all the regions are added based on the year using `rowSums()` and the %Total Birds mass is calculated using the constant birds_bm*
```{r}
chicken_broilers <- (chicken - chicken_layers)*0.9
chicken_layers <- (chicken_layers)* 1.8

chicken_all <- (chicken_broilers + chicken_layers) %>%
  rowSums() %>%
  as.data.frame() * converter

names(chicken_all)[1] <- "Total Biomass (Gt C)"

chicken_all <- chicken_all %>%
  mutate(`% Total Birds` = (`Total Biomass (Gt C)`/birds_bm) * 1e5) %>%
  mutate(`Total Biomass (Gt C)` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)` * 1e-1)

tail(chicken_all)
````
*For ducks (and Turkey), the data is first loaded to `ducks`(`Turkeys`) from `bird_index` similarly as chickens before. The `ducks_all`(`Turkey_all`) then adds all the different regions together which is then multiplied by their avg weight (as per @ipcc) of 2.7 and then converted into Gt C using `converter`. *
```{r}
ducks <- filter(birds_index, Item == 'Ducks') %>%
  select(Area, Year, Value) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Area, values_from = Value) %>%
  column_to_rownames('Year') %>%
  mutate(`Latin America` = `Latin America` - `Northern America`, Asia = Asia - `Indian Subcontinent`)

ducks_all <- ducks %>%  
  rowSums() %>%
  as.data.frame() * converter * 2.7
names(ducks_all)[1] <- "Total Biomass (Gt C)"
ducks_all <- ducks_all %>%
  #mutate(`% Total Animal Biomass (Gt C)` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)`/(wild_animal_biomass)) %>%
  mutate(`% Total Birds` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)`/birds_bm) * 1e5

  
head(ducks_all)
```
```{r}
Turkey <- filter(birds_index, Item == 'Turkeys') %>%
  select(Area, Year, Value) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = Area, values_from = Value) %>%
  column_to_rownames('Year') %>%
  mutate(`Latin America` = `Latin America` - `Northern America`, Asia = Asia - `Indian Subcontinent`)

Turkey_all <- Turkey %>%  
  rowSums() %>%
  as.data.frame() * converter * 2.7
names(Turkey_all)[1] <- "Total Biomass (Gt C)"
Turkey_all <- Turkey_all %>%
  #mutate(`% Total Animal Biomass (Gt C)` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)`/(wild_animal_biomass)) %>%
  mutate(`% Total Birds` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)`/birds_bm) * 1e5

  
head(Turkey_all)
```
*Livestock index loads the dataset on the weight of livestocks in different regions of the world as per the @ipcc. The columns are renamed and rearranged as per the requirement*

```{r}
livestock_index <- read.csv("../../_data/animal_weight.csv",
                       col.names = c('Area','Cattle_dairy', 'Cattle_non_dairy', 'Buffaloes','Swine_market', 'Swine_breeding', 'd',  'd', 'd', 'd', 'Sheep', 'Goats',                                          'Horses','Asses', 'Mules','Camels',  'd')
                       ) %>%
  select(! starts_with("d")) %>%
  filter(! Area == "Middle east") %>%
  arrange(Area) %>%
  column_to_rownames('Area')
livestock_index
```
*As for most of the data, similar wrangling is required, `wrangling_livestock` function has been created which helps in loading the `FAOSTAT_livestock` data(in most cases) and then filtering them out based on the category.*
```{r}
wrangling_livestock <- function (category, file_name = "FAOSTAT_livestock"){
  temp <- read.csv(sprintf('../../_data/%s.csv', file_name)) %>%
    mutate(Area = case_when(
      Area == "Southern Asia" ~ "Indian Subcontinent",
      Area == "Americas" ~ "Latin America",
      TRUE ~ as.character(Area)
    )) %>%
    filter(Area %in% regions) %>%
    arrange(Area, Item) %>%
    filter(Item == sprintf('%s', category)) %>%
    select(Area, Year, Value) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Area, values_from = Value) %>%
    column_to_rownames('Year') %>%
    mutate(`Latin America` = `Latin America` - `Northern America`, Asia = Asia - `Indian Subcontinent`)
  
  return(temp)
}
```
*Dairy and non-dairy cattles have different diets and hence different weights. So, to make the calculations more accurate the data on dairy cattles is loaded from `FAOSTAT_cattle_dairy.csv` which is then filtered to match the regions which we are focussing on. Due to different column naming `wrangling_livestock` function is skipped but is to load data on non-dairy cattles.*
```{r}
cattle_dairy <- read.csv('../../_data/FAOSTAT_cattle_dairy.csv') %>%
    mutate(Area = case_when(
      Area == "Southern Asia" ~ "Indian Subcontinent",
      Area == "Americas" ~ "Latin America",
      TRUE ~ Area
    )) %>%
    filter(Area %in% regions) %>%
    arrange(Area, Item) %>%
    filter(Element == 'Milk Animals') %>%
    select(Area, Year, Value) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Area, values_from = Value) %>%
    column_to_rownames('Year') %>%
    mutate(`Latin America` = `Latin America` - `Northern America`, Asia = Asia - `Indian Subcontinent`)
cattle <- wrangling_livestock('Cattle') - cattle_dairy


head(cattle)
head(cattle_dairy)
```

*To calculate the mass of all the cattles they are multiplied by their respective regional masses and category(dairy/non-dairy) form the `livestock_index` dataframe, the resulting dfs are then added togehter and stored in `cattle_all` where all the different regions are summed together based on the year to get the total biomass/year as well %age total biomass/year*
```{r}
for (r in 1:length(regions)){
  cattle[regions[r]] <- as.double(livestock_index[regions[r],'Cattle_non_dairy']) * cattle[regions[r]]
  cattle_dairy[regions[r]] <- as.double(livestock_index[regions[r],'Cattle_dairy']) * cattle_dairy[regions[r]]
}
cattle_all <- (cattle + cattle_dairy) %>%
  rowSums() %>%
  as.data.frame()%>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Total Biomass (Gt C)")) %>%
  mutate(`Total Biomass (Gt C)` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)`* converter) %>%
  mutate(`% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)`/(mammmal_bm*1e-2))

head(cattle_all)
```
![Estimated Population of Swine](../../_data/IPCC_pigs.png)

*For swine(pigs) the @ipcc assumption is assumed here where close to 90% of them are used for breeding and only 1% are available for market. Based on this assumption `swine_breeding` and `swine_market` dataframes are created using the wrangling_livestock function (loading FAOSTAT_livestock.csv) and then multiplied by their respective weights in different regions. These are then combined to form swine_all where using rowSums the data is categorized into Total Biomass/year and %age Total Mammal Biomass/year.*

```{r}
swine_breeding <- wrangling_livestock("Pigs") * 0.9
swine_market <- swine_breeding / 9

for (r in 1:length(regions)){
   swine_breeding[regions[r]] <- as.double(livestock_index[regions[r],'Swine_breeding']) * swine_breeding[regions[r]]
  swine_market[regions[r]] <- as.double(livestock_index[regions[r],'Swine_market']) * swine_market[regions[r]]
}

swine <- (swine_breeding + swine_market)


swine_all <- swine %>%
  rowSums() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%
  `colnames<-`(c("Total Biomass (Gt C)")) %>%
  mutate(`Total Biomass (Gt C)` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)` * converter) %>%
  mutate(`% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)`/(mammmal_bm*1e-2))

head(swine_all)
```
*In the case of buffaloes, most of the process is same as in cattle except the regions(buffaloes are not present in northern America and west Europe) which are modified to match rest of the tables *
```{r}
buffaloes <- read.csv('../../_data/FAOSTAT_livestock.csv') %>%
    mutate(Area = case_when(
      Area == "Southern Asia" ~ "Indian Subcontinent",
      Area == "Americas" ~ "Latin America",
      TRUE ~ Area
    )) %>%
    filter(Area %in% regions) %>%
    arrange(Area, Item) %>%
    filter(Item == "Buffaloes") %>%
    select(Area, Year, Value) %>%
    pivot_wider(names_from = Area, values_from = Value) %>%
    column_to_rownames('Year') %>%
    mutate(Asia = Asia - `Indian Subcontinent`, `Western Europe` = 0) %>%
    cbind(`Northern America` = 0)

for (r in 1:length(regions)){
  buffaloes[regions[r]] <- (buffaloes[regions[r]] * as.double(livestock_index[r, "Buffaloes"]))
}

buffaloes_all <- buffaloes %>%
  rowSums() %>%
  as.data.frame() %>%

  mutate(`Total Biomass (Gt C)` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)` * converter) %>%
  mutate(`% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)` = `Total Biomass (Gt C)`/(mammmal_bm*1e-2))

head(buffaloes_all)

```
*Sheeps, Goats, Horses, asses and mules follow the same procedure as in cattle and their final values are stored sheep_all, horses_all, asses_all and mules_all respectively.*

```{r}
sheep <- wrangling_livestock("Sheep")

*Camels are not found in Europe, Northern America, Latin America much as livestocks so they have been set to zero for the purpose of calculation. The wild camels in Australia(Oceania) will come under wild Animals (included in analysis later)*
```{r}
camels <- read.csv('../../_data/FAOSTAT_livestock.csv') %>%
    mutate(Area = case_when(
      Area == "Southern Asia" ~ "Indian Subcontinent",
      Area == "Americas" ~ "Latin America",

*The result obtained from poultry and livestocks have been clubbed together below to get much more clearer picture of the distribution of biomass.*
```{r}
poultry <- (chicken_all + Turkey_all + ducks_all) %>%
  select(`Total Biomass (Gt C)`, `% Total Birds`)

wild_birds <- poultry %>%
  mutate(`Total Biomass (Gt C)` = (100 - `% Total Birds`) * birds_bm * 1e-2) %>%
  mutate(`% Total Birds` = (100 - `% Total Birds`))
  
livestocks <- (cattle_all + buffaloes_all + sheep_all + goat_all + horses_all + mules_all + asses_all + camels_all + swine_all) %>%
  select(`Total Biomass (Gt C)`, `% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)`)

wild_animal_biomass <- livestocks %>%
  mutate(`Total Biomass (Gt C)` = (100 - `% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)`) * mammmal_bm*1e-2 - human_pop$`Total Biomass (Gt C)`) %>%
  mutate(`% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)` = (100 - `% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)` - human_pop$`% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)`))
```

**VISUALIZATION**

*The graph below helps in the visualization of the change in biomass of the birds from 1961-2018. It is easy to observe from it that there has been a drastic drop in the wild bird population; from occupying more than 60% of the total biomass of the birds they have dropped to 30% in 2018 whereas the poultry is occupying more than 60%.*
```{r}
rbind(cbind(chicken_all, Category = "Chicken"), cbind(Turkey_all, Category = "Turkey"), cbind(ducks_all, Category = "Ducks"), cbind(wild_birds, Category = "Wild"), cbind(poultry, Category = "Total Poultry")) %>%
  mutate(Time = rep(seq.Date(as.Date('1961-01-01'), length = 58, by = "1 year"),5)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Time, `% Total Birds`, color = Category, fill = Category)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Change in biomass of birds", x = "% Total Birds (Gt C)")
```

*Like in the case of birds, similar situation can be observed in the mammals where the drop is more significant. The wild animals have dropped from almost 50% to ~2% in less than 60 years. The humans have grown to occupy more than 35% of the total biomass in the mammals and the livestock occupy more than 60% of the total biomass.*
```{r}
rbind(cbind(cattle_all, Category = "Cattle"), cbind(swine_all, Category = "Swine"), cbind(buffaloes_all, Category = "Buffaloes"), cbind(wild_animal_biomass, Category = "Wild"), cbind(livestocks, Category = "Total Livestock"), cbind(sheep_all, Category = "Sheep"), cbind(goat_all, Category = "Goat"), cbind(horses_all, Category = "Horses"), cbind(mules_all, Category = "Mules"), cbind(asses_all, Category = "Asses"), cbind(camels_all, Category = "Camels"), cbind(human_pop[, c("Total Biomass (Gt C)","% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)")], Category = "Humans")) %>%
  mutate(Time = rep(seq.Date(as.Date('1961-01-01'), length = 58, by = "1 year"),12)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Time, `% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)`, fill = Category, color = Category)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + theme_minimal()

```
*While most nations have started dealing with carbon emissions, methane(which has a shorter life cycle) is coming under greater focus each year. The largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions is agriculture, responsible for around a quarter of the total, closely followed by the energy sector, which includes emissions from coal, oil, natural gas and bio fuels. With the visualization below I try to showcase the relation between human population growth and methane emission. It is often thought that only livestock are the major contributors but from the visualization obtained it is apparent that other human activities have a significant impact on the emission.*
```{r}
methane <- read.csv("../../_data/ghg-concentrations_fig-1.csv", skip = 6) %>% 
  slice(1860:1964) %>% 
  `colnames<-`(c("Year", "d", "Methane (ppm of C02)")) %>% 
  select(contains("e")) %>% 
  fill(`Methane (ppm of C02)`, .direction = "updown")%>%
  filter(as.numeric(Year) %in% human_pop$Year) %>%
  slice(-c(38))
head(methane)
```
```{r}
livestocks %>%
  mutate(Methane = methane$`Methane (ppm of C02)`, Time = seq.Date(as.Date('1961-01-01'), length = 58, by = "1 year"), Humans = human_pop$`% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)`) %>%
  mutate(Methane = sapply(Methane, function(x){
    return (100*(x- min(Methane))/(max(Methane) - min(Methane)))
  }) ) %>%
  mutate(factor = Methane/Humans) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = factor)) +
  labs(y = "Growth Rate", title = "Growth Rate of Methane wrt Humans")
```


```{r}
livestocks %>%
  mutate(Methane = methane$`Methane (ppm of C02)`, Time = seq.Date(as.Date('1961-01-01'), length = 58, by = "1 year"), Humans = human_pop$`% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)`) %>%
  mutate(Methane = sapply(Methane, function(x){
    return (100*(x- min(Methane))/(max(Methane) - min(Methane)))
  }) ) %>%
  ggplot(aes(Time)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Methane), color = "blue", fill = "blue", stat = "identity") +
  geom_line(aes(y = `% Mammal Biomass (Gt C)`), color = "red", fill = "red", stat = "identity") + 
  geom_line(aes(y = Humans), color = "green", fill = "green", stat = "identity") + theme_minimal()
```
*To sum up all of my findings from this project together, the visualization below showcases the change in biomass of birds and mammals in the past ~60 years in Gt C. Although the share of birds has always been low, the drop in wild animals is very concerning.*
```{r}
as.data.frame(rbind(cbind(poultry$`Total Biomass (Gt C)`, category = "Poultry"), cbind(livestocks$`Total Biomass (Gt C)`, category = "Livestocks"), cbind(wild_birds$`Total Biomass (Gt C)`, category = "Wild Bird"), cbind(wild_animal_biomass$`Total Biomass (Gt C)`, category = "Wild Terrestrial Mammals"), cbind(human_pop$`Total Biomass (Gt C)`, category = "Humans"))) %>% 
  mutate(Time = rep(seq.Date(as.Date('1961-01-01'), length = 58, by = "1 year"), 5), `Total Biomass` = (as.numeric(V1))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Time, y = `Total Biomass`, fill = category, color = category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(title = "Biomass Distributions of Birds and Mammals over the years", y = "Total Biomass in Gt C")
```
**REFLECTION**
*Due to dealing with multiple(10) sheets in this project, I had to deal with repetitive coding as structure of each sheet was different.I have used piping extensively in this project in order to decrease the number of variables. I decided to focus on poultry, livestock and humans in this project as I wanted to showcase human impact. I dived deep and segregated the data as much as possible to get an accurate result. For the purpose of maintaining standards and to be able to compare it with actual results in the world I decided to follow IPCC and FAOSTAT for all the information regarding weight and population.*
*As the data was classified on the basis of the regions, I chose to focus on different regions of the world based on the geography. As a result I ended up separating Asia into Asia and Indian Subcontinent and clubbing Australia and surrounding countries Oceania. Also, a major assumption made is that the total biomass on earth 550 Gt C.*
*Although I ended up merging all of the regions together for the sake of visualization, if allowed to continue this project I would like to study all of the different regions separately as well as this might give insights on which region is experiencing most of the changes. Desertification is major problem in Africa and is surely to be major factor in the obtained results*


**INFERENCE**

*Though we have been aware of climate change and importance of a healthy Eco-system for more than three decades, the continuing sharp decline in the wild is concerning and proves that we are much farther away from a solution than we think. Though this project focuses on biomass distribution over the years some of the information can be linked with present situations to get verify the current situations. The rapid decline in the wildlife population is also an indication to the rapid deforestation, which has been a rising problem over the years. Besides this, we can also observe how the livestock have almost doubled in population when compared to humans. Today, the global cattle population amounted to about one billion, which makes it increasingly believable than Iceland has more sheep than human (that's close to 3 sheep per person). This also,raises the topic of till what time will earth be able to sustain the growing food demands. Earth Overshoot Day is the date that marks that we have consumed all the resources that our planet is capable of generating in one year. Each year it is calculated by dividing the planet's bio capacity by humanity's ecological footprint and multiplying by 365, for the number of days in a year. In 2021, 29th July was the Earth Overshoot Day. It was first recorded in 1970 and the overshoot day was 29 December.*
